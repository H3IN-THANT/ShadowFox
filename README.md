# ShadowFox ML Internship Projects

This repository contains the work I completed during my Machine Learning internship. It includes two core projects:

-  **Image Tagging Model** (Beginner Level)
-  **Car Price Prediction Model** (Intermediate Level)

Each project demonstrates practical ML concepts, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## 📁 Project Overview

### 1. Image Tagging Model

A beginner-friendly project that builds a basic image classification model to tag images with relevant labels.

- **Dataset:** CIFAR-10 for demonstration purposes, since it's available in TensorFlow and already labeled
- **Model Type:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Goal:** Classify images into predefined categories

### 2. Car Price Prediction Model

An intermediate-level regression model to predict the price of cars based on various features.

- **Dataset:** Car features and price dataset 
- **Model Type:** Regression using Random Forest
- **Features:** Year, selling_price, fuel type, transmission, kms_driven, etc.
- **Goal:** Predict resale price of a vehicle

> ⚙️ This project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and model evaluation techniques.
